# Smart Advertisement - Microsoft Engage 2022

A Face Recognition Application that utilises the benefit to show 
ads depending on the gender, age, and facial expression with a 
prototype for Smart Advetisement Boards

The future of advertisement is changing, personalization is key. 
Even for in-store sales, ad banners and digi boards need to upgrade
to leverage the use of new technology.
